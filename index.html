    <p style="margin-top: 30px"; class = "cover_letter"; >My name is Apostolos Foivos Varelas and I am an undergraduate student of Digital Systems at University of Pireaus. I have a strong background in programming and a passion for technology. During my time at the University of Peiraus, I have already gained extensive experience in various programming languages, such as: C, Java, Python and more. I have also developed a strong foundation in artificial intelligence and cloud engineering. My coursework and hands-on projects have equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of the latest trends and best practices in the IT industry.</p>
    <p class = "cover_letter"; > In addition to my technical qualifications, I am an avid cyclist and runner, which I believe has helped me develop the discipline and perseverance necessary for success in a fast-paced, ever-evolving field like technology. My passion for gaming has also nurtured my ability to think critically and solve complex problems.</p> 
    <p class = "cover_letter"; style="margin-bottom: 150px";>In the future, I have a strong desire to focus on several goals that are important to me. Firstly, I want to dedicate ample time and effort to work on my personal projects that I am passionate about. Secondly, I aspire to achieve a higher and more fulfilling position in my career that allows me to grow and learn as a professional. Thirdly, I aim to develop something innovative and unique that can make a positive impact on society. Finally, I have a strong interest in conducting thorough research on topics that intrigue me and can provide valuable insights for the betterment of our world.
